We plan on using the Chinese technique in Vietnam.

To interview the engineers and technicians at the refinery which already implements the technique.

I thought there was a problem that we can't be certain that we will be able to continue to get the catalyst because it is very special and there is only once company that manufactures the product s if the company goes bankrupt, we can't run the refinery, but the licensing company said they guarantee to provide the catalyst.

My role in this project is to make suggestions to our boss in headquarters.

My colleague who was a trader in China got the information.
