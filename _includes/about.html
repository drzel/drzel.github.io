                    <p>Hey, how's it going? I'm Sheldon. I'm an English teacher.</p>
                    <p>There are lots of reasons to learn English, and many ways to learn. There's no silver bullet when it comes to learning a new language, but there are some approaches that work better than others.</p>
                    <p>Often the most difficult thing for Japanese English students to overcome is their anxiety to get it "right". when it comes to language, this anxiety makes it more difficult to remember what we learn.</p>
